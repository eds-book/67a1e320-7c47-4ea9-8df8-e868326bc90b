  title: Sea ice forecasting using the IceNet library (Jupyter Notebook) published in the Environmental Data Science book
  short_title: Daily sea ice forecasting (IceNet)
  abstract: IceNet is a python library that provides the ability to download, process, train and predict from end to end. Users can interact with IceNet either via the python interface or via a set of command-line interfaces (CLI) which provide a high-level interface that covers the above abilities. This project demonstrates the use of the python library API for forecasting sea ice for a reduced dataset to demonstrate the end-to-end capabilities of IceNet, from source data download to forecast generation.
